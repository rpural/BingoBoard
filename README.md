Project: Create a numbers called board for a Bingo night at the KofC

![image](bingoboard.png)

This repository contains a Bingo Board program and related programs and files for a Bingo night. The intention would be to put the large window
showing all the numbers on to a large screen HDMI television, with the smaller window on the computer, allowing someone to enter the numbers as
they are called. These would then be displayed highlighted on the large board.

This program uses PyQt5 to format the displays. All code is Copyright Robert P. Nix, 2023
