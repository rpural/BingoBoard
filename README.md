Project: Create a numbers called board for a Bingo night at the Knights of Columbus

![image](bingoboard.jpg)

This repository contains a Bingo Board program and related programs and files for a Bingo night. The intention would be to put the window
showing all the numbers on to a large screen via HDMI or a network connection to the television. On the computer, clicking on the
individual numbers will highlight them as the numbers are called.

Version 2.0 introduces an "automatic" mode, which generates random numbers and places them on the board based on
a repeat time given by the user. The timing can run from "manual", meaning that one number will be called each time
the start button is clicked, up to automatically doing the next call every 60 seconds. There is a Pause button
to pause the game (i.e. to check someone's Bingo). The game resumes when Start is pressed again. Clear clears
the board and starts a new game.

A more robust command line syntax is implemented, allowing for both displaying numbers generated externally
(like with a traditional ball tumbler) or for running the game entirely generating random calls within the
program. Options are implemented to change the page header title and message.

Version 4.0 consolidates the controls on to the main window. Using an app called "AirParrot", the screen can be mirrored
to several televisions. Display of the currently called number is displayed more prominently at the top of the screen.

Version 5.0 introduces color pallettes to allow different display colors on the board. It adds a --pallette switch to
select which pallette to use, and defaults to "default". The individual pallettes are defined in pallettes.py, which
associates a set of CSS attributes with each type of display element. New pallettes can be defined in pallettes.py
by following the pattern used in the three examples given there.

There are controls for clearing the board, and exiting the program. When calling
numbers automatically, the time between calls can be changed, and the calls can be paused (like when checking a
winning card). In addition, for manual calling, the numbers in the main window are clickable.

Logs are produced containing the date and time of each game, and the numbers called during the game.
